# Task: Python Pattern Drawing


- Create three different patterns using Python's printing capabilities.

### Pattern 1: Right-angled Triangle
Write a Python program that prints a right-angled triangle pattern. The number of rows should be specified by the user. For example, if the user enters 5, the output should look like this:

```javascript
*
**
***
****
*****

```

### Pattern 2: Square with Hollow Center
Write a Python program that prints a square pattern with a hollow center. The program should take the size of the square as input from the user. For example, if the user enters 5, the output should look like this:

```javascript
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
*****

```

### Pattern 3: Diamond
Write a Python program that prints a diamond pattern. The program should take the number of rows (height) for the diamond from the user. For example, if the user enters 5, the output should look like this:

```javascript
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *

```

### âž¡ Instructions:

1. Use nested loops to control the row and column structure.
2. You can use the print function to output patterns. To create spacing, you can use the space character (" ") or tabs ("\t").
3. Prompt the user to enter the necessary parameters for each pattern.
